## Getting Started with Lab

> **Note:** We recommend having strong internet connectivity while performing the lab. Please ensure you are not connected to a VPN as this can slow down the lab-user experience.

1. When the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will be loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine to perform the lab.

2. To receive lab environment details, select the **Environment Details** tab. Additionally, the credentials will be sent to the email address you provided at registration.

   **Note:** If you see the pop-up **experience.cloudlabs.ai would like to access the Clipboard to copy text**, please click on **Allow**.

### Known Issues
