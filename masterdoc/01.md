## Getting Started with Lab

> **Note:** We recommend having strong internet connectivity while performing the lab. Please ensure you are not connected to a VPN, which can slow down the lab-user experience.

1. When the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will be loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine to perform the lab.

   >**Note:** Please minimize the PowerShell window when it appears, do not close it, and wait 15 minutes for the process to complete.
   
3. To receive lab environment details, select the **Environment Details** tab. Additionally, the credentials will be sent to the email address you provided at registration.

   **Note:** If you see the pop-up **experience.cloudlabs.ai would like to access the Clipboard to copy text**, please click on **Allow**.
