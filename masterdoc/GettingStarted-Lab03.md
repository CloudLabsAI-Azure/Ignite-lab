# Analytics in Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform (MIDP)

### Overall Estimated Duration : **90 Minutes**

## Overview

Azure Databricks and Power BI are key components in the Microsoft ecosystem for handling large datasets, enabling machine learning, and delivering business intelligence insights. This lab focuses on exploring these technologies by utilizing MLOps, sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics to drive business decisions at Wide World Importers. By leveraging Azure Databricks, you will deploy machine learning models for customer churn prediction and sentiment analysis, then operationalize them through Azure Machine Learning services. These models will be used to optimize marketing campaigns, sales forecasting, and improve customer engagement.

You will also utilize Power BI to derive actionable insights from enriched datasets stored in the Lakehouse. With the integration of campaign analytics, churn analysis, and website performance metrics, this lab will demonstrate how Wide World Importers can target the right customer segments, improve customer experiences, and forecast sales using data from the Lakehouse.

## Objective

**Exploring Machine Learning and Business Intelligence on the Lakehouse:** Learn to deploy machine learning models for customer churn prediction and sentiment analysis using Azure Databricks, and operationalize them through Azure Machine Learning services. Gain hands-on experience with integrating these models into business processes, such as campaign analytics and sales forecasting, to enhance decision-making. Additionally, explore how to leverage Power BI for analyzing data stored in the Lakehouse, uncovering insights into customer behavior, marketing effectiveness, and website performance. This process will develop skills in machine learning, data analytics, and the integration of business intelligence tools to drive data-driven outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Basic Knowledge of Azure Databricks and Azure Machine Learning:** Familiarity with the Azure portal, creating and managing resources in Azure Databricks, and deploying machine learning models using Azure ML.
- **Understanding of Machine Learning Concepts:** Basic understanding of machine learning models, including training, validation, and deployment processes, specifically for tasks like churn prediction and sentiment analysis.
- **Basic Knowledge of Power BI:** Familiarity with Power BI for importing datasets, building reports, and analyzing data to derive business insights.
- **Familiarity with Data Storage Concepts:** Understanding of how data is organized and stored in a Lakehouse environment, especially within the context of Azure Databricks and Synapse Analytics.
- **Basic SQL Skills:** Ability to write and execute simple SQL queries for querying data in Azure Synapse Analytics and Databricks.

## Architecture

The lab architecture involves a structured flow where Azure Databricks is used to manage machine learning pipelines with MLflow, ensuring seamless data processing, model training, and deployment. A Databricks Delta Table acts as a centralized storage solution for structured data, enabling efficient access and analysis. MLflow is utilized to track experiments, register models, and manage their lifecycle. The trained models are operationalized as ML services in Azure Machine Learning, exposing REST endpoints for consumption. Business intelligence and advanced analytics tasks are performed using Power BI and SQL Analytics, providing actionable insights. This integrated flow supports efficient data processing, machine learning, and business intelligence workflows.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Databricks Delta Table:** Acts as a centralized data storage layer, enabling high-performance data access and supporting machine learning tasks.

- **MLflow:** A framework for tracking machine learning experiments, registering models, and managing the model lifecycle. It supports different model flavors, such as Scikit-learn and XGBoost.

- **Model Registry:** A centralized repository within MLflow that allows versioning, approval, and lifecycle management of models.

- **Azure Machine Learning Services:** Provides a platform to deploy machine learning models as REST endpoints. It integrates with Azure Container Registry for hosting containerized models and ensures scalable and monitored deployment.

- **Power BI:** A business intelligence tool used to generate reports and dashboards, allowing users to derive actionable insights from the Lakehouse data.

- **SQL Analytics (Azure Synapse and Azure Databricks):** Tools for performing advanced SQL-based queries on data stored in the Lakehouse, facilitating deeper data exploration and insights.
